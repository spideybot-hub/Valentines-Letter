                    <h2>Happy Valentine's Day 💝</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hey Darling,Zero Two,Princess,Kristin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve been sitting here for a while trying to figure out the right way to say this, 
                        and I realized that being "cool" or "brief" just wasn’t going to cut it.
                         I wanted to take a second to actually tell you what’s been on my mind lately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ever since we met on Where Winds Meet, you’ve become a person I genuinely look 
                        forward to hearing from every single day. There’s something about your energy and honestly,
                         just the way you are that makes everything feel a little brighter and more interesting.
                          I find myself constantly impressed by the way you care about me and understand me,
                           and I’ve realized that I don't want to let a day like Valentine's go by without
                            letting you know that.I know the holiday can be a bit cliché, but I’d really 
                            love an excuse to treat you to a day that’s all about you. I want to be the reason you’re 
                            smiling next week..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, I’ll just come out and ask: Kristin, 
                        would you do me the honor of being my Valentine?
                        I’d love to spend the 14th with you and just spend some real time together.
                         No pressure, just us. Regardless of the answer, I’m just really glad you’re in my life,
                          but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t hoping for a "yes."
                    </p>
